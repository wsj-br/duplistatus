- **Server Name**: Server name configured in the Duplicati server
- **Alias**: A nickname or human-readable name of your server. When hovering over an alias it will show its name; in some cases to make it clear it will display the alias and the name between brackets.
- **Note**: Free text to describe the server functionality, installation place, or any other information. When configured, it will be displayed next to the name or alias of the server.
- **Web Interface Address (URL)**: Configure the URL to access the Duplicati Server's UI. Both `HTTP` and `HTTPS` URLs are supported. If not configured, the Duplicati button will be disabled and the name of this server will not be shown in the `Duplicati configuration` button list.
- **Status**: Display the test results when you click `▷ Test` or `Test All` buttons.
- **Actions**: You can test the connection and open the URL configured in a new browser tab.

> [!TIP]
> After entering an address, test it using the `Test` or `Test All` button.
