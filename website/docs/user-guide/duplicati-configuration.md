# Duplicati Configuration

The `Duplicati configuration` button on the [Application Toolbar](overview#application-toolbar) opens that server's web interface in a new tab.

You can select a server from the dropdown list. If you have already selected a server (by clicking its card) or are viewing its details, the button will open that specific server's Duplicati configuration directly.

- The list of servers will show the `server name` or `server alias (server name)`.
- Server addresses are configured in `Settings → Server Addresses`.
- The application automatically saves a server's URL when you use the `Collect Backup Logs` feature.
- Servers will not appear in the server list if their address has not been configured, and the `Duplicati configuration` buttons for those servers will be disabled.
