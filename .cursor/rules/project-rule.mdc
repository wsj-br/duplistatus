Instructions:
- Do not start the development server (`pnpm dev`) or production server (`pnpm start`).
- Use `pnpm lint` to check for errors when modifying the code. Only if needed, use `pnpm build`.
- When creating or modifying code, always use a proper TypeScript interface instead of `any`.
- When creating the git commit message, do not include the version number change in the headline, but keep it in the change detail list.
- Always follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to make the codebase more maintainable.
- Ask questions if you need clarification.
