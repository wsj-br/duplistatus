Instructions:
  - don't run the application automaticaly, use pnpm build or pnpm lint to check for errors.
  - when creating or modifying code allways use a proper TypeScript interface instead of any.
  - when creating the git commit message, don't include in the headline the version number change, but keep it in the change detail list.
  - always follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and makes the codebase more maintainable.
