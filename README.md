# **duplistatus** - Another [Duplicati](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati) Dashboard

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.6.0-blue)

<br>


This web application monitors and visualizes backup operations from [Duplicati](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati). **duplistatus** provides a comprehensive dashboard to track backup statuses, metrics, and performance across multiple machines. It also provides API endpoints that can be integrated with third-party tools such as [Homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/).

## Installation

The application can be deployed using Docker, [Portainer Stacks](https://docs.portainer.io/user/docker/stacks), or Podman. See details in the [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).

<br>

## Duplicati Servers Configuration (Required)

Once your **duplistatus** server is up and running, you must configure your **Duplicati** servers to send backup logs to **duplistatus**, as outlined in the [Duplicati Configuration](INSTALL.md#duplicati-configuration-required) section of the Installation Guide. Without this configuration, the dashboard will not function properly.

<br>

## User Guide

See the [User Guide](USER-GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on how to configure and use **duplistatus**, including setup, features, and troubleshooting.

<br>

## API Reference

For detailed information about all available API endpoints, request/response formats, and integration examples, please refer to the [API Endpoints Documentation](API-ENDPOINTS.md).

<br>

## Development

Detailed instructions on how to download the source code, make changes, debug, and run in development mode can be found in the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file.
This application was developed almost entirely using AI tools. The step-by-step process and tools used are described in [HOW-I-BUILD-WITH-AI.md](docs/HOW-I-BUILD-WITH-AI.md).

## Migrating to Version 0.6.0

Your database will automatically be updated when you start the new version. The process is safe, and your data will be preserved.

<br>

### The Migration Process

The system performs these steps automatically:

  - **Creates a backup** of your existing database. The backup file is named `duplistatus-backup-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.db`.
  - **Runs the migration**, which adds new columns to the `backups` table, a `configurations` table for settings, and a table to track the database version.
  - **Keeps all your existing data** while enhancing the database structure.

<br>

### How to Monitor

Check the Docker logs for progress by running:

```bash
docker logs <container-name>
```

Look for these messages to confirm a successful migration:

  - `"Found 1 pending migrations"`
  - `"Running consolidated migration 2.0..."`
  - `"Migration 2.0 completed successfully"`
  - `"Database backup created: /path/to/backups-copy-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.db"`
  - `All migrations completed successfully`


<br>

### If You Need to Roll Back

In the rare event of an issue, you can restore your database by following these steps:

1.  Stop the `duplistatus` container.
2.  Replace the current database file with the backup file. 
    - usual location is `/var/lib/docker/volumes/duplistatus_data/_data/`
    - check your current configuration and installation to the correct path.
3.  Restart the container.
