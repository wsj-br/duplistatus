# **duplistatus** - Another [Duplicati](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati) Dashboard

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.6.1-blue)

<br>


This web application monitors and visualizes backup operations from [Duplicati](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati). **duplistatus** provides a comprehensive dashboard to track backup statuses, metrics, and performance across multiple machines. It also provides API endpoints that can be integrated with third-party tools such as [Homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/).

## Installation

The application can be deployed using Docker, [Portainer Stacks](https://docs.portainer.io/user/docker/stacks), or Podman. 
See details in the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALL.md).

<br>

## Duplicati Servers Configuration (Required)

Once your **duplistatus** server is up and running, you must configure your **Duplicati** servers to 
send backup logs to **duplistatus**, as outlined in the [Duplicati Configuration](docs/INSTALL.md#duplicati-configuration-required) 
section of the Installation Guide. Without this configuration, the dashboard will not function properly.

<br>

## User Guide

See the [User Guide](docs/USER-GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on how to configure and use **duplistatus**, including setup, features, and troubleshooting.

<br>

## API Reference

For detailed information about all available API endpoints, request/response formats, and integration examples, please refer to the [API Endpoints Documentation](docs/API-ENDPOINTS.md).

<br>

## Development

Detailed instructions on how to download the source code, make changes, debug, and run in development mode can be found in the [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) file.
This application was developed almost entirely using AI tools. The step-by-step process and tools used are described in [HOW-I-BUILD-WITH-AI.md](docs/HOW-I-BUILD-WITH-AI.md).

## Migrating to Version 0.6.0

Your database will automatically update when you start the new version. This process is safe and preserves all your existing data.

<br>

### The Migration Process

The system automatically performs the following steps:

- **Creates a backup** of your current database. The backup file is named `duplistatus-backup-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.db`.
- **Runs the migration**, which adds new columns to the `backups` table, creates a `configurations` table for settings, and adds a table to track the database version.
- **Preserves all your existing data** while improving the database structure.

<br>

### Monitoring the Migration

To monitor progress, check the Docker logs by running:

```bash
docker logs <container-name>
```

Look for these messages to confirm a successful migration:

- `"Found 1 pending migrations"`
- `"Running consolidated migration 2.0..."`
- `"Migration 2.0 completed successfully"`
- `"Database backup created: /path/to/backups-copy-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.db"`
- `"All migrations completed successfully"`

<br>

### Rolling Back (If Needed)

If you encounter issues, you can restore your database by following these steps:

1. Stop the `duplistatus` container.
2. Replace the current database file `backups.db` with the backup file.
   - The default location is `/var/lib/docker/volumes/duplistatus_data/_data/`
   - Verify the correct path based on your current configuration and installation.
3. Install the previous version of `duplistatus` container image (`wsjbr/duplistatus:v0.5.0`)
4. Restart the container.
5. Please report the issue in the [duplistatus project](https://github.com/wsj-br/duplistatus/issues) on GitHub, including the Docker logs.
