# Version 1.1.x

## Overview

Version 1.1.x is a minor release that addresses critical issues with overdue backup detection, improves Podman container compatibility, and introduces container architecture improvements. This release focuses on fixing overdue backup detection accuracy and resolving networking issues in Podman environments.

## New Features

### User Interface Enhancements

- **Right-click context menu on auto-refresh button** - Right-clicking on the auto-refresh button in the application toolbar opens the Display Settings page for quick access to display preferences
- **Improved collect backups modal** - Password field label now clearly indicates "(only fill if password changed)" when a server is selected, making it clearer when the field is needed

### Documentation Improvements

- **Documentation hosting migration** - Documentation has been moved from the Docker container image to GitHub Pages at https://wsj-br.github.io/duplistatus/user-guide/overview for improved accessibility and easier updates
- The User Guide link in the app header now points to the external documentation site

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical: Overdue Backup Detection - Complete Reimplementation

- **Fixed overdue backup detection** - Completely reimplemented overdue backup detection system with a new algorithm that properly tracks expected backup dates:
  - Algorithm ensures manual backups don't change scheduled backup times (e.g., manual backup at 10pm won't change a 2pm schedule)
  - Fixed "Next Run" column in overdue monitoring settings showing incorrect dates
  - Backup settings are now immediately updated after receiving backups via `/api/upload` or `/api/backups/collect`
  - For new servers without Duplicati sync, uses the first backup's time-of-day as the schedule reference
  - For more details, see the [Overdue Detection Algorithm](https://github.com/wsj-br/duplistatus/blob/main/dev/OVERDUE_DETECTION_ALGORITHM.md) documentation

### Podman Container Fixes

- **Fixed Podman pod networking** - Resolved issue preventing external access to the application when running in Podman pods. The server now correctly binds to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0:9666`) in both Podman pod and standalone container modes
- **Fixed DNS resolution for Tailscale hostnames** - Resolved DNS resolution issues in Podman containers that prevented connecting to Tailscale hostnames or custom DNS servers. Updated the install documentation with instructions.

### Email Configuration Fixes

- **Fixed SMTP empty username/password handling** - Resolved issue where clearing the username or password fields in email configuration would still store encrypted values in the database. Empty fields are now properly stored as empty strings and can be cleared correctly

### System Improvements

- **Reduced console logging** - AuditLogger now only logs failed login attempts to console; all other audit entries are written to database only

## 🚀 Migration Notes

### From Version 1.0.x

When upgrading to version 1.1.0:

1. **Documentation Location Change** - Documentation is now hosted on GitHub Pages instead of being included in the Docker container. The User Guide link in the app header now points to the external documentation site

2. **Podman Container Configuration** - If using Podman pods, ensure DNS configuration is set at the pod level using `--dns` and `--dns-search` flags. The application now works correctly in both Podman pods and standalone containers

3. **Overdue Backup Detection** - The overdue backup detection system has been completely reimplemented with a new algorithm that preserves schedule time-of-day. Existing overdue monitoring configurations will continue to work, but you may notice more accurate "Next Run" dates in the overdue monitoring settings. The new algorithm ensures that manual backups don't shift scheduled backup times

4. **No Database Migration Required** - This release does not require any database schema changes
