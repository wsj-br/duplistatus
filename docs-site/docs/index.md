# duplistatus Documentation (Migrated)

This site is a MkDocs Material scaffold created to migrate the existing Docusaurus documentation located at `./website`.

This is a work-in-progress migration. The original `./website` folder will be preserved; this site copies the docs into `./docs-site/docs/` so you can iterate on conversion.

See README.md in the repository root for more information.
